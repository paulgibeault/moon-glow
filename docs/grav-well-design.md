# Gravity Well — design document

**A faithful falling-block stacker for [Paul's Arcade](https://paulgibeault.github.io/).**
`gameId: grav-well` · repo: `paulgibeault/grav-well` · target URL: `https://paulgibeault.github.io/grav-well/`

> *The playfield in a falling-block game has been called **the well** since the genre began. Ours has gravity. All's well that lands well.*

This document is the v1 design, written against the fleet's
[GAME_INTEGRATION.md](https://github.com/paulgibeault/paulgibeault.github.io/blob/main/GAME_INTEGRATION.md)
(SDK major v3). §-references below point at that file. It is comprehensive on
purpose: the mechanical spec in §2 is the part every clone gets subtly wrong,
so it is written down to the kick table.

---

## 1. Concept & positioning

**What it is.** A faithful *modern-guideline* falling-block stacker: 7-bag
randomizer, SRS rotation with full wall kicks, hold, ghost piece, soft/hard
drop, lock-delay with move reset, T-spins, back-to-back, combos, perfect
clears. The feel players know from any current-generation stacker — no
surprises, no house rules in the core.

**What it is not.** Not the NES/classic ruleset (no spawn-orientation
randomizer quirks, no DAS charge carry), and not a variant-mechanics remix.
Faithfulness *is* the design. Original expression everywhere else: name, art,
sound, and copy are ours.

**Naming & IP hygiene.** Game mechanics are not protectable; names, logos and
trade dress are — and the rights holder for the famous one polices hard,
including `-tris`-suffixed names. So: the game is **Gravity Well** — display
name; the repo slug and `gameId` are `grav-well`, and per §1 of the guide the
catalog `id` must match the slug (fleet precedent: `si-syn` ↔ *Silicon
Syndicate*). Pieces are called **tetrominoes** (the generic mathematical
term, not the trademarked
spelling), a 4-line clear is a **Quad**, and the word Tetris appears nowhere in
the shipped product — not in UI copy, file names, or the catalog entry. This
document may name it; the game never does. Standard piece hues (see §5 below)
are genre-wide convention used by every open clone and stay, with our own
rendering treatment.

**Theme.** A deep well of stars. Blocks are salvage sinking into a gravity
well; the stack glows faintly against the dark; a line clear collapses with a
gravitational shimmer; a perfect clear is a **Singularity**. Tone matches the
fleet: restrained, atmospheric, negative space — tension from depth, not from
screen shake.

**Fleet fit.** Nine catalog games, no falling-block game — this fills the most
canonical gap in any arcade. Sibling precedent followed throughout: `moon-lit`
for canvas + soundpack + power-saver posture, `sowduku`/`cardstock` for SDK
storage discipline.

### Catalog entry (draft — the §1 registration PR)

```json
{
  "id": "grav-well",
  "name": "Gravity Well",
  "subtitle": "Falling Blocks",
  "icon": "/grav-well/icon.png",
  "url": "/grav-well/",
  "inDevelopment": true,
  "profile": {
    "subtitle": "A Faithful Falling-Block Stacker",
    "alt": "Gravity Well — glowing tetromino blocks sinking into a starlit stone well",
    "descLead": "The well is deep. Keep it clear.",
    "descBody": "A faithful modern stacker: 7-bag randomizer, SRS wall kicks, hold, ghost piece, T-spins, back-to-back and combo scoring. Marathon, Sprint 40, Ultra, Zen, and a shared Daily Well dig on the same seed for everyone.",
    "kicker": "All's well that lands well.",
    "tags": ["HTML5 Canvas", "JS", "ES Modules", "PWA", "Arcade SDK"],
    "codeUrl": "https://github.com/paulgibeault/grav-well"
  }
}
```

Ships with `"inDevelopment": true` at first registration (the guide's honest
early-ship ribbon) and drops the flag at M3. **Icon art direction:** square
≥ 512 px, served from this repo's root — looking straight down (or up) a
stone-ringed well at a starfield, one glowing T-piece mid-fall. Must read at
tile size; matches the `alt` text.

---

## 2. The faithful core — mechanical specification

The reference behavior is the modern guideline as implemented by
current-generation stackers. Everything in this section is pure logic
(`js/core/`), DOM-free, deterministic, and pinned by unit tests.

### 2.1 Playfield

- Grid **10 columns × 40 rows**; rows 1–20 visible, 21–40 hidden buffer above.
- The **skyline**: pieces spawn in rows 21–22 (just above the visible field),
  horizontally centered, rounding left — J/L/S/T/Z occupy columns 4–6, I
  occupies 4–7, O occupies 5–6 (1-indexed). Spawn orientation: flat side down.
- A spawned piece is immediately subject to gravity (falls on its first tick
  if unobstructed).

### 2.2 The seven tetrominoes

| Piece | Cells (spawn) | Hue (both themes) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I | 4-in-a-row | cyan |
| O | 2×2 | yellow |
| T | T | purple |
| S | S | green |
| Z | Z | red |
| J | J | blue |
| L | L | orange |

An **accessibility glyph mode** (settings toggle) stamps each piece with a
distinct engraved rune so color is never the only channel.

### 2.3 Randomizer — 7-bag

All seven pieces shuffled as a bag, dealt in order, bag refilled when empty.
Shuffle uses the fleet PRNG (§7c of the guide): the vendored, byte-identical
`js/arcade-rng.js` companion (`makeRng(seed)` → `rng.shuffle(bag)`), so bags
are reproducible from one u32 seed and the algorithm is pinned by the
known-answer vectors the guide publishes (`makeRng(42)` →
`0.6011037519201636, …`). Casual runs seed from entropy; Daily Well seeds from
`dailySeed('grav-well')` (device-local calendar day, per the platform
rule).

### 2.4 Rotation — SRS with full kick tables

Rotation states: `0` (spawn), `R` (CW), `2` (180°), `L` (CCW). On a rotation
input the piece tries the 5 offsets for that transition in order; the first
non-colliding placement wins, else the rotation fails (no state change).
Offsets below in guideline convention, **(x, y) with +y up** (the
implementation's y-down mirror is pinned against these exact tables in tests).

**J, L, S, T, Z:**

| Transition | Test 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0→R | (0,0) | (−1,0) | (−1,+1) | (0,−2) | (−1,−2) |
| R→0 | (0,0) | (+1,0) | (+1,−1) | (0,+2) | (+1,+2) |
| R→2 | (0,0) | (+1,0) | (+1,−1) | (0,+2) | (+1,+2) |
| 2→R | (0,0) | (−1,0) | (−1,+1) | (0,−2) | (−1,−2) |
| 2→L | (0,0) | (+1,0) | (+1,+1) | (0,−2) | (+1,−2) |
| L→2 | (0,0) | (−1,0) | (−1,−1) | (0,+2) | (−1,+2) |
| L→0 | (0,0) | (−1,0) | (−1,−1) | (0,+2) | (−1,+2) |
| 0→L | (0,0) | (+1,0) | (+1,+1) | (0,−2) | (+1,−2) |

**I:**

| Transition | Test 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0→R | (0,0) | (−2,0) | (+1,0) | (−2,−1) | (+1,+2) |
| R→0 | (0,0) | (+2,0) | (−1,0) | (+2,+1) | (−1,−2) |
| R→2 | (0,0) | (−1,0) | (+2,0) | (−1,+2) | (+2,−1) |
| 2→R | (0,0) | (+1,0) | (−2,0) | (+1,−2) | (−2,+1) |
| 2→L | (0,0) | (+2,0) | (−1,0) | (+2,+1) | (−1,−2) |
| L→2 | (0,0) | (−2,0) | (+1,0) | (−2,−1) | (+1,+2) |
| L→0 | (0,0) | (+1,0) | (−2,0) | (+1,−2) | (−2,+1) |
| 0→L | (0,0) | (−1,0) | (+2,0) | (−1,+2) | (+2,−1) |

**O:** rotates in place (identity, no kicks, always succeeds).

No 180° rotation input in v1 — classic SRS has none and faithfulness wins;
it's listed under Future (§12) as an off-by-default option.

### 2.5 Hold, next queue, ghost

- **Hold** (once per piece): swaps active ↔ held, held piece re-enters in
  spawn orientation at the spawn position; re-enabled when a piece locks.
- **Next queue:** 5 previews.
- **Ghost piece:** rendered at the hard-drop landing position; toggleable.

### 2.6 Gravity & levels

Fall speed follows the guideline curve — seconds per row at level *n*:

```
t(n) = (0.8 − (n − 1) × 0.007) ^ (n − 1)
```

| Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 15 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| s/row | 1.000 | 0.793 | 0.618 | 0.355 | 0.135 | 0.064 | 0.028 | 0.007 |

- Level advances every **10 lines** (fixed goal). Marathon runs levels 1–15
  (150 lines); an **Endless** toggle continues the curve past 15, clamped to
  20G (instant drop) once reached.
- **Soft drop:** 20× current gravity by default (SDF configurable, up to
  instant). **Hard drop:** teleports to the ghost position and locks
  immediately.

### 2.7 Lock delay — Extended Placement

- A piece resting on a surface locks after **500 ms**.
- Any successful move or rotate resets the timer — up to **15 resets**;
  once spent, moves still work but the timer keeps running out.
- Falling to a **new lowest row** restores the 15-reset budget.
- Hard drop ignores all of this (locks instantly).

### 2.8 Movement tuning — DAS / ARR

Own key-repeat implementation (never OS auto-repeat):

| Parameter | Default | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DAS (delay before auto-shift) | 167 ms | 67–333 ms |
| ARR (auto-repeat rate) | 33 ms/cell | 0 (instant) – 83 ms |
| SDF (soft-drop factor) | 20× | 5× – instant |

All three are player-configurable in settings — modern stackers made tuning
these table stakes, and they cost nothing to expose.

### 2.9 Line clears, T-spins & scoring

Award = table value × level (drops are flat, not level-multiplied):

| Action | Award |
| --- | --- |
| Single / Double / Triple | 100 / 300 / 500 |
| **Quad** (4 lines) | 800 |
| Mini T-Spin (no lines) / Mini T-Spin Single / Mini T-Spin Double | 100 / 200 / 400 |
| T-Spin (no lines) / Single / Double / Triple | 400 / 800 / 1200 / 1600 |
| Perfect clear: Single / Double / Triple / Quad / B2B Quad | 800 / 1200 / 1800 / 2000 / 3200 |
| Back-to-Back (Quads & T-Spin clears chained, breaks only on a plain clear) | ×1.5 on the clear award |
| Combo (consecutive clearing locks) | +50 × combo count × level |
| Soft drop / hard drop | +1 / +2 per row (flat) |

**T-spin detection — 3-corner rule.** A lock is a T-Spin when (a) the piece is
a T, (b) its **last successful maneuver was a rotation**, and (c) at least 3
of the 4 cells diagonal to the T's center are occupied (walls and floor
count). It is a **full** T-Spin if both corners on the T's pointing side are
occupied; otherwise **Mini** — upgraded to full when the rotation used the
table's last kick (the (±1, ∓2) "TST" kick). In-theme flavor text only; the
mechanic keeps its genre-standard name in UI so players recognize it.

### 2.10 Top-out

- **Block Out:** a piece cannot spawn without overlap → game over.
- **Lock Out:** a piece locks entirely above the visible field → game over.
- Zen mode softens both (see §3).

### 2.11 Timing model & determinism

Fixed-timestep simulation at **60 logic ticks/s**, accumulated from
`Arcade.loop` deltas (render decoupled; cell-snapped movement, so no
interpolation needed). All randomness flows from one seeded `makeRng`
instance whose state (`getState`/`setState`) serializes with the run. Inputs
are reduced to `(tick, action)` events — the whole game is
`nextState = reduce(state, event)`, which buys three things: mid-run
suspend/restore is exact (§6b of the guide), a run is replayable from its
seed + input log, and the entire core is unit-testable under `node --test`.

---

## 3. Modes

| Mode | Rules | Persistence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Marathon** | Levels 1–15 / 150 lines; Endless toggle continues the curve. The default mode. | leaderboard `marathon`, record `marathon-score`, resumable run snapshot |
| **Sprint 40** | Clear 40 lines fastest. Instant retry on `R`. | record `sprint-40` (`duration-ms`, lower-is-better) |
| **Ultra** | 3:00 on the clock, max score. | leaderboard `ultra`, record `ultra-score` |
| **Zen** | Level-1 gravity forever, no top-out (an overflowing well gently sinks the bottom rows away), untimed. | lines/session stats only, resumable |
| **Daily Well** | One shared seed per device-local day (`Arcade.daily.seed()`): the well starts with 8 rows of seeded debris — dig it clear, fastest time. Same debris, same bag stream, for every player. | leaderboard `daily` keyed by `dateStr` (`order: 'asc'`), streak in stats |

Every mode keeps its own resumable snapshot (fleet convention — switching
modes never costs progress).

---

## 4. Controls

**Keyboard (remappable):** ←/→ move (DAS/ARR) · ↓ soft drop · Space hard drop
· ↑ or X rotate CW · Z or Ctrl rotate CCW · C or Shift hold · P/Esc pause ·
R retry (instant in Sprint/Ultra, hold-to-confirm elsewhere).

**Touch:** on-screen button cluster by default (precision beats gestures for
stacking): left/right/soft-drop pads on one side, rotate CW/CCW + hard drop +
hold on the other — **anchored per `Arcade.settings.handedness()`**
(`data-handedness` flips the layout). An optional gesture layer (drag to
shift with DAS-equivalent feel, flick down to hard drop, tap zones to rotate)
is a settings toggle, off by default.

**Gamepad:** M4 (the launcher's iframe `allow` already includes `gamepad`).

---

## 5. Presentation

**Rendering.** HTML5 canvas, layered: a cached background (starfield +
well walls; re-rendered on resize/theme change), an offscreen board layer
(locked cells; redrawn on lock/clear), active piece + ghost drawn per frame,
and an FX layer (line-clear collapse ≤ 250 ms). HUD (score/level/lines/timer,
hold + next previews) is DOM beside the canvas.

**Loop policy (§6a/§6d of the guide).** `Arcade.loop` is the only frame
source. During live play a piece is always falling, so the loop runs —
gameplay-essential motion. On menus, pause, settings and game-over the loop
is **parked** and state changes render via `kick()`: visible-but-idle is a
flat main thread at 0 fps, verified in a Performance trace. The starfield
drifts only while the play loop already runs (it never justifies frames on
its own), is **disabled under `powerSaver`**, and freezes under
`reducedMotion`.

**Danger state.** When the stack crosses row 16 a vignette pulse warns —
`animation-iteration-count: var(--arcade-pulse-count, 3)` declared as the
longhand, settling to a static tint that keeps saying "high stack" (contract
gates A/B). Never `infinite`, nothing loops while idle.

**Theme (§5).** Both launcher themes supported via `Arcade.settings.theme()`:
dark is the flagship night-well; light is a dawn-well palette (pale sky at
the top of the shaft, same seven piece hues, contrast-checked). Canvas
branches on the setting; DOM keys off `[data-theme]`.

**Reduced motion.** Line clears become instant removal, the collapse shimmer
and landing effects are skipped, the starfield is a still frame. Canvas/JS
checks `Arcade.settings.reducedMotion()`; DOM inherits the SDK kill-switch.

**Font scale.** HUD text in `rem` (free scaling via the SDK's injected root
rule); all `ctx.font` sizes multiply by `Arcade.settings.fontScale()`,
re-rendered on `Arcade.onSettingsChange`.

**Power saver.** Read defensively (`Arcade.settings.powerSaver ?
Arcade.settings.powerSaver() : false` — contract gate C): drops the
starfield drift, particle FX, and the ambient audio bed; pulse count follows
the token ladder automatically.

---

## 6. Audio — a graph-cue soundpack (§5 of the guide)

Spec-cue chiptune is the wrong palette for this game's tone; the pack is
built from the element library's physical gestures, lives in
`js/soundpack.js` (design only — synthesis stays in the framework), and is
registered via `ArcadeAudioElements.registerPack({...})` →
`window.ArcadeSoundPack`, auditioned offline with the launcher's
`tools/soundpack/` renderer.

- **Room:** one deep stone cistern (`decay ≈ 1.1`) — every cue shares it, so
  overlapping sounds fuse into the well rather than stacking into a pile.
- **Cues** (each varied per play via the seeded `rnd` stream — no
  byte-identical repeats): `shift` a featherweight high-passed `strike`;
  `turn` strike + tiny `body`; `touch`/`lock` low `thump` + resonant `body`;
  `clear` `shatter` scaled by lines cleared; `quad` a restrained `blast` with
  a high `send` (heard far up the shaft); `tspin` a `creak` — stick-slip is
  the sound of a piece twisting into a slot; `hold` a single `ratchet`
  detent; `levelup` a rising `body` gliss; `topout` the bed dying under one
  deep `thump`.
- **Bed:** `well-hum`, a sustained `drone` started with
  `Arcade.audio.start()`, **retuned** (`h.retune({ depth }, 3.0)`) as the
  stack crosses quantized height thirds with hysteresis — never per frame.
  Off under `powerSaver`; optional in settings.
- **Fallback:** none, by design — without `arcade-audio.js` the game plays
  silent (fleet posture: the pack *is* the sound). Requires SDK ≥ 3.7
  (`retune`); volume/mute arrive free via `Arcade.audio`.

## 7. SDK integration map (§ → what Gravity Well does)

| Guide § | Commitment |
| --- | --- |
| §1 Identity | `grav-well` everywhere: repo slug, catalog `id`, Pages path, storage namespace. `index.html` at repo root. |
| §2 SDK | Evergreen `/arcade-sdk.js` + `Arcade.init({ gameId: 'grav-well' })` in `<head>`; all boot after `await Arcade.ready`; no pre-ready state reads or writes. |
| §3 Storage | Every durable byte through `Arcade.state` (schema in §8 below); `getOrInit` for settings; `onStateReplaced` re-boots to the menu and re-hydrates snapshots (imported saves are treated as a fresh boot); storage-full left to the SDK's default toast. |
| §3a Async stores | Not used in v1 — every save fits `Arcade.state`. Replay archives would be the first `Arcade.store` consumer (M4). |
| §3b Sync | `settings` and mode snapshots opt in (`{ sync: true }`, all ≪ 64 KB); records/scores merge via the launcher already. |
| §3c Migration | Fleet-native from day one — no legacy keys, no `adopt` needed. `migrate('v1')` reserved for future reshapes. |
| §4 Profile | `Arcade.player.name()` for board entries; **scores** `marathon`, `ultra`, `daily` (keyed by date, `order: 'asc'`); **records** `sprint-40` (`duration-ms`, lower), `marathon-score`, `ultra-score` (integer, higher); **stats** counters (below). |
| §5 Settings | Theme, fontScale, reducedMotion, handedness, powerSaver, audioVolume — all honored as specified in §5–6 above; one `onSettingsChange` subscription flips cached multipliers and kicks a redraw. |
| §6 Lifecycle | `onSuspend`: pause sim, park loop, suspend audio, **synchronously flush the run snapshot**; `onResume`: reset accumulators, stay on the pause screen (never auto-unpause into gameplay). Eviction-safe by construction: the snapshot is written on every lock and on suspend. |
| §6d Idle | 0 fps outside live play; finite pulses on the token; Performance-trace verified. |
| §7 UI chrome | `Arcade.ui.toast` for records ("New best!"); `Arcade.ui.confirm` for destructive resets; `onBeforeQuit` flushes the snapshot (sync write, then `true` — never a veto-trap); `Arcade.ui.setTitle('Gravity Well — Sprint 1:23.45')` style titles. |
| §7a Multiplayer | v1 is single-player; `peer.*` untouched. Versus design sketched in §12. |
| §7b Safe rendering | The only off-device strings are score-entry names → rendered via `textContent`/`Arcade.html.escape`, always. |
| §7c Determinism | Vendored `js/arcade-rng.js` (byte-identical, KAT-pinned); `Arcade.daily.seed()` for Daily Well; `Arcade.share.encode({ seed, mode }, { v: 1 })` challenge codes — decode validates version and rejects others. |
| §7d Configs | Not in v1 (no packs/variants yet). |
| §8 Standalone | Fully playable at the Pages URL; nothing gates on `framed`. |
| §9 Sandbox | No direct `localStorage`/`indexedDB`/SW-registration assumptions; fullscreen only on user gesture; no top-navigation. |
| §10 PWA | `manifest.json` scoped `/grav-well/`; `sw.js` from the reference template: scope-filtered fetch, per-asset `add()`, `ignoreSearch`, own-prefix cache cleanup, `arcade:sw.skipWaiting` handler, CI-owned `const APP_VERSION = '0.0.0';`, generated precache markers. |
| §11 Launcher presence | Catalog entry + icon per §1 above. |
| §12 Local dev | Developed against `./dev.sh ../grav-well`; `?dev=1` tracing during handshake work. |
| §13 Acceptance | `npm run acceptance` from the launcher against the staged game is an M2 exit gate. |
| §13a CI/CD | Thin `pages.yml` caller (`version_bump: true`, `contents: write`); `tools/stage.mjs` (standard tracked-files staging) + byte-identical `verify-artifact.mjs` / `inject-precache.mjs`; tests in `tests/`, Node ≥ 24; Pages source = GitHub Actions. |

---

## 8. Persistence schema

All under `arcade.v1.grav-well.*` via the SDK:

| Key | Contents | Flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settings` | DAS/ARR/SDF, ghost, glyph mode, key map, touch scheme, bed on/off, lockdown mode | `sync: true` |
| `run.<mode>` | Mid-run snapshot: board, active piece + rotation state, bag `rng.getState()`, queue, hold, score/lines/level/combo/B2B, elapsed, reset budget | `sync: true` |
| `stats` (via `Arcade.stats`, category `core`) | gamesPlayed & per-mode counts, total lines/pieces, quads, tspins, perfect clears, max combo, play time, daily streak | — |
| replay/telemetry buffers (M4) | input logs | `exportable: false` |

Records and scores as listed in §7. A launcher Save → Load round-trip
restores every one of these (acceptance item).

---

## 9. Testing

The core is pure and reduced-form, so the suite is real, fast, and zero-dep
(`node --test 'tests/*.test.js'`, fleet default):

- `bag.test.js` — every 7-window is a permutation; first 14 pieces pinned for
  seed 42 (also pins the vendored PRNG via its known-answer vectors).
- `srs.test.js` — the §2.4 kick tables pinned verbatim; wall/floor kick
  fixtures; the TST kick; O-piece identity; failed-rotation no-ops.
- `tspin.test.js` — 3-corner fixtures: full vs mini, wall/floor corners,
  kick-upgrade, rotation-last requirement.
- `score.test.js` — the §2.9 table; B2B chains across Quads and T-spins
  (and what breaks them); combo runs; perfect-clear detection.
- `gravity.test.js` — curve values for levels 1–15 to 3 decimals; lock-delay
  reset budget and lowest-row restore.
- `game.test.js` — reducer determinism: seed + input log → identical final
  state hash, twice; Block Out / Lock Out; hold rules.
- `serialization.test.js` — mid-run snapshot round-trip, RNG state included:
  resumed run replays identically to an uninterrupted one.
- `repo-gates.test.js` — fleet floor (every tracked JS/JSON parses).

`npm test` = `node tools/verify-artifact.mjs && node --test 'tests/*.test.js'`
(the `moon-lit` pattern). Pre-merge locally: launcher `contract-gates.mjs`,
`render-smoke.mjs` (title screen draws immediately — no `tools/smoke.mjs`
hints needed), and the §13 acceptance checklist via `dev.sh`.

- [ ] Records/leaderboards live for all modes; daily streak tracked
- [ ] `inDevelopment` flag dropped — full catalog citizen

**M4 — Beyond (unscheduled).** 1v1 Versus over `Arcade.peer` (deterministic
sims exchanging input/garbage events; garbage rows with attacker-seeded hole
columns; ride `'interrupted'` without resetting — the queue-and-replay
contract fits turn-paced garbage exchange well), replay capture & theater
(`Arcade.store`), gamepad, 180° rotation option, shareable challenge codes.

## 12. Open questions

1. **Ultra length** — spec says 3:00; 2:00 is the snappier convention some
   stackers use. Preference?
2. **Daily Well format** — seeded 8-row dig-race (spec) vs a seeded Ultra.
   Dig differentiates days more, Ultra is simpler. Both?
3. **Touch default** — button cluster (spec) vs gesture-first. Buttons are
   more faithful to precision play; gestures are what mobile players expect.
4. **Endless cap** — clamp at 20G, or hard-stop Marathon at 15 and keep
   Endless a separate toggle (spec)?
